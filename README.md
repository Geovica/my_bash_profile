# my_bash_profile


A typical install of OS X won't create a .bash_profile for you. When you want to run functions from your command line, this is a must-have.

Start up Terminal

1. Type "cd ~/" to go to your home folder
2. Type "touch .bash_profile" to create your new file.
3. Edit .bash_profile with your favorite editor (or you can just type "open -e .bash_profile" to open it in TextEdit).
4. Type "source .bash_profile" to reload .bash_profile and update any functions you add.
