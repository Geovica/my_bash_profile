# my_zsh_profile


A typical install of OS X won't create a .zshrc for you. When you want to run functions from your command line, this is a must-have.

Start up Terminal

1. Type "cd ~/" to go to your home folder
2. Type "touch .zshrc" to create your new file.
3. Edit .zshrc with your favorite editor (or you can just type "open -e .zshrc" to open it in TextEdit).
4. Type "source .zshrc" to reload .bash_profile and update any functions you add.
